assignment1:
    write a program to find least freequency number from the list.

program:
   
import math as mt
 
def leastFrequent(arr, n):
     Hash = dict()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] in Hash.keys():
            Hash[arr[i]] += 1
        else:
            Hash[arr[i]] = 1
    min_count = n + 1
    res = -1
    for i in Hash:
        if (min_count >= Hash[i]):
            res = i
            min_count = Hash[i]
       return res
arr = [1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
n = len(arr)
print(leastFrequent(arr, n))


output:
